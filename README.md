# ML-Nutriento (in develompment phase)

## Description
An application that, based on images, shows the number of calories of the meal that is in the image.

## Implementation
The transfer learning method is used due to the lack of images in the data set. Currently, only about 100 images are in the dataset.

Currently in Version 1 of the application is used EfficientNet_V2_S model. 

Dataset contains only three classes: shushi, steak and pizza. 

Plan is to add more classes and to expand dataset with more images.
